This project will strengthen the Nordic ESM (Earth System Modeling) community by supporting their efficient use of various e-infrastructures through competence building, and sharing and exchanging knowledge. It will result in increased efficiency of ESM teams and will open doors for future scientific and technical collaborations.

## Activities

In this project the expertise in the Nordic ESM community will be pulled together in three focus areas:

### ESGF node administration

- Installation, configuration, update and maintenance. 
- Expected benefits:
	- Lowered cost and reduced time required to bring an ESGF node into operation
	- Lowered cost for ESGF node maintenance
	- Improved service and reliability of Nordic ESGF nodes

### ESM competence building

- Training to build, run & analyse; efficient use of models, building documentation, sharing tools. 
- Expected benefits:
	- Lowered entrance barrier for new ESM users
 	- Increased knowledge about efficient use of models and associated tools
 	- Harmonized tools or methods (e.g. diagnostics) where appropriate
 	- Increased mobility and collaboration among climate modellers
 	- Reduced technical burden of building and running an ESM by researchers and allow them to concentrate on doing science
	- Reduced support burden on national HPC providers
	- Improved HPC resource usage through code optimization, improved load balancing, more robust production work-flow and improved data management


### ESM data quality control 

-Knowledge exchange, training and support for systematic QC of ESM data published on ESGF nodes. 
- Expected benefits:
	- Shared training of modelers/data providers to run QC as a routine once the data is generated
	- Higher quality of published data leading to fewer retracted data sets ultimately improving user
experience, and reducing scientistsâ€™ workload
	- Stronger Nordic ESM community through expert knowledge exchange on QC
	- Saved time, HPC and archiving resources through optimised QC standards and procedures
