## Why?

The objectives of INES are:

- Upgrade and maintain a cutting-edge and verified ESM suitable for the national climate science community and participation in international model intercomparison projects.

- Provide an infrastructure for efficient model simulations, storage, analysis and validation available for the national climate science community and collaborating international groups.

- For efficient sharing of model data, provide an infrastructure that connects to international data grids and ensures that model data complies with established standards of the climate community.
