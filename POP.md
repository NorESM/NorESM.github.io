PURPOSE:

To provide an open, lightweight, easy to use, text-based standalone guide to building open events of all kinds

To share knowledge, codes (climate models, tools for analyzing climate data and visualization tools), inform about training opportunities within the Nordic countries Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Norway) to help anyone to better understand climate changes at high-latitudes.


OUTCOMES:

- People get information on climate at high latitudes and why and how climate change impact our community.
- Our community can discuss and share knowledge about climate at high latitudes.
- Information on climate models, climate data analysis and visualisation that can be used to study climate impacts at high latitudes can be easily found and/or added by our community.
- Training opportunities in the Nordics are regularly posted.

PROCESS:

- Create a Github organization to gather information about tools, climate models used in the Nordic countries. Add links to international initiatives too.
- Create new repositories (website, galaxy tools)
- Research new resources with help from colleagues and community
- Write up guides on how to contribute
- Request feedback and invite contributions
