## Vision

*A hub for sharing knowledge and resources on Earth System Modelling in the Nordic countries.*

The NordicESMHub github organization provides the Nordic Earth System Modeling Community with a focal point for sharing knowledge, codes (climate models, Galaxy climate data analysis and visualization tools), training tutorials.

The focal point or centre of the hub is the [NordicESMHub website](). 

### PURPOSE:

To connect students, researchers and citizen living in Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Norway) so they can collaborate and share knowledge, tools and codes (climate models, tools for analyzing climate data and visualization tools) used for studying climate changes at high latitudes. The reason is that Nordic countries are large but with few inhabitants. So your closest colleague (in distance and time to travel) is often located in a neighbouring country.


### OUTCOMES:

- People add/get informed on [nordicESMHub website](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/) about Climate E-Science (climate modelling, data analysis and visualization, programming) training opportunities that are close to where they live and work,
- People add/update information on climate models, climate data analysis and visualisations that they use to study climate changes at high latitudes,
- Our community fosters a culture of sharing best practices for Climate modeling in the Nordics

### PROCESS:

- Create [NordicESMHub Github organization](https://github.com/NordicESMhub) to gather information about tools, climate models used in the Nordic countries. Add links to international initiatives that are relevant for our community too.
- Create [NordicESMHub website](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/) with guidelines on how to contribute so that it can be updated by our community
- Create new repositories for sharing codes (climate models, visualization, diagnostic tools, etc.)
- Get new resources with help from colleagues and community
- Write up guides on how to contribute
- Request feedback and invite contributions
