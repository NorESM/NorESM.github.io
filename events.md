### Add an event

- Create a [new file](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordicesmhub.github.io/new/master/_events) in the `_events` directory.
- Update title, description, start and end date, etc. If you are willing to add a figure you can either add a link or you would need to upload the corresponding picture in [images/events](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordicesmhub.github.io/upload/master/images/events).
- finally save your changes and make a pull request.
