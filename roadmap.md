# Roadmap

_A hub for sharing knowledge and resources on Earth System Modelling in the Nordic countries_.

The _NordicESMHub_ github organization provides the **Nordic Earth System Modeling Community** with a focal point for sharing knowledge, codes (climate models, Galaxy climate data analysis and visualization tools), training tutorials.

## What do we need to do?

### **Milestone**: Github project

- Create a new Github project at the organization level and link milestones to the roadmap
- Add/update README, LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING files in the main repository https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordicesmhub.github.io and in each existing repository of the NordicESMhub Github organization

### **Milestone**: NordicESMHub Website

Update https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordicesmhub.github.io to show:
- how the NordicESMhub is organized
- what information can be found depending on who you are (citizen, students, teachers, researchers, etc.)
- what we do
- Calendar of relevant events (workshops/tutorials) in the Nordics
- how to contribute

### **Milestone**: Tools packaging with conda

- NordicESMhub conda channel can be fed automatically through https://github.com/NordicESMhub/esmconda-recipes 

### **Milestone**: Galaxy tools

- Development of Earth System Modeling tools for Galaxy
- Deployment of Earth System Modeling tools in the Galaxy tool shed

### **Milestone**: Galaxy Training for Earth System Modelling

Organize a workshop for learning on
-  how to use Galaxy for Earth System Modelling
- how to develop new tools and deploy them in the Galaxy toolshed
