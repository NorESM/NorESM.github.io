# Beginner

As a part of the [EVA](https://www.nersc.no/project/eva) project, where scientists developed the Norwegian Earth System Model, [NorESM](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/projects/noresm/), a teaching tool was developed to show how climate modelers view the system around them.

[Explore the Earth](https://expearth.uib.no/) to understand Climate systems!

[See Earth the way climate modelers view it](https://www.bjerknes.uib.no/en/article/nyheter/see-earth-way-climate-modelers-view-it), a blog written by Andreas Hadsel Opsvik to get more information.
