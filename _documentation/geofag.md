Documentation for those at the Department of Geosciences of the University of Oslo (Norway) interested in working with computer modeling and data analysis in Earth Sciences

- This [documentation](https://uio-geofag-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is generally specific to the University of Oslo.

- Note that in some cases, the content does not yet exist, in which case you are encouraged to [contribute](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/geofag-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) by editing and adding information, or contact one of the site maintainers to request further information.

- Provide information on software tools available for data analysis and scientific program for projects within the field of Geosciences in general and to provide users a cenral resource for keeping notes on UIO specific aspects of running various software routines. Ideally, this site will become overtime a 'go to' location where incoming students who will be working with modeling and heavy data analysis on servers can find tips for getting started.

- **Enjoy!**
