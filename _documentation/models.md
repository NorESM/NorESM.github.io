We will give here a list of relevant models we use in the Nordic countries.


# EC-EARTH

[EC-Earth](https://www.ec-earth.org) is a global climate model system developed by a consortium of 27 research institutes from 10 European countries. General information about EC-Earth can be found on [this website](https://www.ec-earth.org) and more detailed information for EC-Earth developers is found at the [EC-Earth Development Portal](https://dev.ec-earth.org) (account needed).

# NorESM

[NorESM](https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a global earth system model based on the CESM but with different components for the ocean and atmospheric chemistry-aerosol-cloud-radiation.

# Oslo-CTM3

# CESM

[CESM](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/) is a fully-coupled, community, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states.

# WRF/WRF-CHEM

# FLEXPART

[FLexpart](https://www.flexpart.eu) is a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model. It supports NorESM input winds in addition to the standard ECMWF IFS. 

# OpenIFS
