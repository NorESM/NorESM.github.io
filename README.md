## Welcome!

First and foremost, Welcome! :tada: :rocket: :balloon:

Thank you for visiting the Nordic Earth System Modeling Hub project repository.

This README file is a hub to give you some information about the project.

## What are we doing?

**Vision/Mission statement:**

The aim of the Nordic Earth System Modeling Hub to build a Nordic ESM community within the 
Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Norway) for sharing knowledge, 
codes (climate models, Galaxy climate data analysis and visualization tools), 
training tutorials so that our contributions to the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project can be easily exploited/reused within the Nordic countries and beyond, 
and by other communities.


### The problem

- Students, PhDs, postdocs, researchers often have to re-invent the wheel and waste lots of time to find out
where to find NorESM climate data, which model configurations are supported to run, how to visualize data 
over the Nordics i.e. which projection to use, etc. 
- The number of inhabitants in each Nordic country is little (12 millions in Sweden, about 6 millions in Finland 
and Norway but 300 000 inhabitants in Iceland) so it is often difficult to find specialists working on 
similar problems within your own University and country.


### The solution

* provide the Nordic ESM community with up to date information (i.e. documentation that can be easily updated by contributors)
* connect students, PhDs, postdocs and researchers by providing a knowledge map, listing skills and competences.
* make the Nordic contributions more visible and favor new collaborations.


## Who are we?

The founder of the NordicESMHub is [Anne][link_AnneFouilloux]. 

The development of this project is mentored by [Bérénice][link_BereniceBatut] as part of the 
[Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) 
[Round 7](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-7/).

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-7/issues/40).


## What do we need?

- Web designers/developers for setting up the Nordic ESM Hub website:
	- get help to create a map of knowledge listing skills and competences
	- get help to set up a calendar of events on our website
- Get help to learn how to better advertise our action within the Nordics.
- [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) experts for setting up nordicesmhub conda channel so we can share our tools
- [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) programmers for the development of tools

To get more information, see our [roadmap](https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-7/issues/40).
