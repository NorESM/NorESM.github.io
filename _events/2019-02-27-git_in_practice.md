This is not a Software Carpentry, but a [self-organized 1-day workshop](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/courses/other/Carpentry/software-carpentry/time-and-place/190227_git) based on CodeRefinery lesson material.

**Requirements**: Software Carpentry - introduction to Git. 

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed in the full course information).
