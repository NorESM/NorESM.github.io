[BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/) brings together the Galaxy Community Conference and Bioinformatics Open Source Conference to meet jointly online.

BCC2020 is packed full of joint & parallel sessions, keynotes, poster & demo sessions, birds-of-a-feather, and social events. The meeting encompasses a week of activities, including two optional pre-conference training days, a three-day main meeting, and four post-meeting collaboration days. BCC2020 events are held twice: once in North American Eastern Daylight Time (GMT-4) (BCC West), and again in Australian Eastern Standard Time (GMT+10) (BCC East), with registration rates based on your employment status and your country's economic status. You can choose some or all of it to attend.
