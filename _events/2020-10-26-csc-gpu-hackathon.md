The goal of the GPU Hackathon is for current or prospective user groups of large-scale, GPU-accelerated systems to port their applications to GPU accelerators or to further optimize already ported applications. Participating teams should leave the event either with applications running on GPUs or a clear roadmap of next steps to leverage GPUs.
