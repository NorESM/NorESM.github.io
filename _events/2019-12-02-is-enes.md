The IS-ENES3/ESGF Virtual Workshop on Compute and Analytics is a web meeting organized in the context of the EU H2020 IS-ENES3 project in close collaboration with the Earth System Grid Federation international effort.

The Virtual Workshop will discuss users’ requirements, solutions, gaps and challenges about the compute and analytics services in the climate change domains. 

Talks on state of the art implementations in this field as well as applications built on top of them will be presented. The main outcome of the workshop, which will collect all contributions from the participants, will be documented into a final report on “Compute service requirements and state of the art approaches”.
