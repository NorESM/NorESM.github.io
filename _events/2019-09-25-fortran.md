3 day training event funded by [PRACE](http://www.prace-ri.eu/) and organized at [CSC](https://www.csc.fi/).

The Fortran programming language is still - despite of its long history - one of the standard and most useful languages in scientific computing. Our course will give the participants the basic knowledge on the Fortran 95 programming language as well as some glimpses on the Fortran 2003/2008 standards and their new features. Best practices for obtaining high performance with Fortran will also be discussed. Both days include lectures and practical hands-on exercises.
