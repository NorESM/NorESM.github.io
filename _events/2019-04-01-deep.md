It is a 5-day workshop given for [DEEP: Norwegian Research School for Dynamics and Evolution of Earth and Planets](https://www.mn.uio.no/ceed/english/research/doctoral-degree/national-phd-school/). Lesson material is based on [Carpentry lesson on Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and [CodeRefinery lesson material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/). Additional episodes have been added to cover specific needs of the Dynamics and Evolution of Earth and Planets community.

**Requirements**:  To fully benefit from this 5 day course, you need to have knowledge on Dynamics and Evolution of Earth and Planets (Master level). No prior knowledge of Python is required but knowledge of another programming language is a strong advantage. You need to understand the concepts of files and directories and how to start a Python interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson sometimes references Jupyter Notebook although you can also use any Python interpreter mentioned in the Setup.

The commands in this lesson pertain to Python 3.


Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed in the full course information).
