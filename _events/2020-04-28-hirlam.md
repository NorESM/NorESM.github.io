A workshop will be organised at FMI to present the current status of coupling regional atmosphere and ocean modelling systems and discuss our future plans.

## Nordic coupled atmosphere-wave-ice-ocean modelling workshop

- **Time**: 28.-29.4 2020
- **Place**: Brainstorm Auditorium, FMI, Erik Palm√©nin aukio 1, Helsinki, Finland

Join us to discuss how to forward coupling of the atmosphere, wave, ice and ocean models both for operational forecasting and climate and ocean reanalysis!

The workshop topics cover, but are not limited to:
- NWP and oceanographic models presently used
- Coupling physics
- Technical solutions for coupling
- Benefits and challenges of model coupling
- Data assimilation
- Requirements on computational resources
- Funding opportunities

The first day of the workshop focuses on presenting our current knowledge. The second day is reserved for discussions on how we want to go forward and what it requires.

**We invite participants from Meteorological and Marine Institutes that are involved in regional NWP, oceanographic forecasting and climate and ocean reanalysis.**

*Please register to the meeting by sending an email to Laura Tuomi (laura.tuomi@fmi.fi)*.

- Participants willing to give a presentation are asked to send a title and a short abstract (300 characters).
- Deadline for registration and for abstracts is **27.3.2020**
