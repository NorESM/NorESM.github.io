The [ELIXIR Galaxy Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy) organizes a 4-days workshop at Roscoff (France) related to Galaxy tool integration and training.

During the first day, the attendees will learn about the integration of high-quality tools within Galaxy with their dependencies (Bioconda, Planemo) using the IUC best practice guidelines. 
They will also learn how to use Galaxy as a training tool and develop training material for the Galaxy Training Network.

The second half of the workshop will be dedicated to Hackathon sessions where attendees will be able to bring their own projects around 
tool integration and/or training material and develop them collaboratively, with the support of community experts.
