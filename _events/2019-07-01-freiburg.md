## 2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)

GCC2019 will be held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July. Like previous Galaxy Community Conferences, GCC2019 will feature invited keynotes, accepted talks, posters, and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, multiple days of collaborative work, and plenty of opportunities to network with your fellow data-intensive researchers and practitioners. 

And this year the **Climate Community* will be represented in the Diverse Community Track!
