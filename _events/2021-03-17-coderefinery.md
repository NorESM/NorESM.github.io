Bring your code and learn how to write tests for it with the help of a mentor!

# Information

In this mini-hackathon, you will become familiar with tools and best practices for testing research software and get help in adopting these in your own projects.

- Day 1 will be devoted to learning - we go through the CodeRefinery lesson on automated testing and work on exercises in breakout rooms where you can use your favorite programming language. At the end of day 1 you will be paired up with a mentor who will be available to answer your questions while you get started on implementing tests in your code.

- On day 2 we split into small groups by programming language. We will work in breakout rooms and learners will get help from mentors in designing and implementing tests for their code and setting up the necessary infrastructure. At the end of day 2 we briefly summarize the progress made for each project and discuss lessons learned.


The CodeRefinery workshop will take place online, 2 half days in total:

- **When**: March 17 and 24, 9:00 - 12:30 (Central European Time, 2 half-days)
- **Information and registration**: [https://coderefinery.github.io/2021-03-17-testing-hackathon/](https://coderefinery.github.io/2021-03-17-testing-hackathon/)
