Everybody talks about open science. But what does it mean exactly?

This summer school is for anyone interested in learning more about what academic research will look like in the future. We want to bring together established scientists and early career researchers to provide a stimulating, yet friendly, learning environment. No preliminary knowledge of open science is required!

The course will take place over five days, with a large part of the program dedicated to workshops and tutorials. Instructors will present their experience and expertise on how you can adopt open science tools and best practice to your research more efficient, reproducible, visible and impactful.

Programme and registration (deadline 17/07/2019) [here](http://osip2019.epfl.ch/).
