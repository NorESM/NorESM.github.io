**Advancing research through machine learning: an applied coding workshop.**

Information and registration [here](https://www.esciencecenter.nl//workshop-machine-learning-for-research).

Are you a researcher and do you have a challenging research question that might benefit from machine learning, deep learning or AI? And do you have the data to start working on this question? If so, this workshop is for you.

Tell us about your idea and your team (3-5 people). From all submitted ideas we will invite up to five teams to spend a week of hands-on work with two machine learning experts.
