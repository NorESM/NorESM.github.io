The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research software development. The main focus is on professional tools for efficiently developing and maintaining research software. Since most research code is developed in a collaborative setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate this process. Most of the content is also relevant to a single developer.

# Information

We have the pleasure to announce the CodeRefinery upcoming online workshop on Best Software Practices!

The CodeRefinery workshop will take place online over two weeks, 6 half days in total:

- **When**: May 25-27 and June 2-4, 9:00-12:15 CEST
- **Information and registration**: [https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-05-25-online/](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-05-25-online/) 

For this workshop we are inviting anyone to attend as learners. 
We also have a new option to join the workshop as a team, where a team can have 4-6 learners and one helper (someone experienced in using the tools). Each member of a team still needs to register.

We are also looking for helpers for this workshop. If you have attended a CodeRefinery workshop in the past, please consider to join as a helper! Itâ€™s fun and very instructive.

## Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:

- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

**If yes, then this course is for you. Participants are not "professional code developers" or computer scientists.**

If you develop research code and you know all the tools already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn something new about a subject by teaching it.

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed in the full course information).
