The NeIC conferences are organised biannually bringing together around 230 experts, researchers, policy makers, funders and national eInfrastructure providers from the Nordics and beyond. The aim is to create an opportunity for people in the eInfrastructure field to connect and collaborate with colleagues across the Nordics and to enable them to share knowledge and expertise. The title for this year’s event is ‘Nordic Infrastructure for Open Science’. 

NeIC2019 is a collaboration between [CSC](https://www.csc.fi/), [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/), [NeIC](https://neic.nordforsk.org/), [RHnet](http://www.rhnet.is/english/), [SNIC](http://www.snic.se/), and [UNINETT Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/).
