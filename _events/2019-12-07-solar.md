**Online participation available**

An important objective of this workshop is to gather ideas and community support to develop CATCH working groups in order to focus research on emerging CATCH topics and research challenges. Therefore, this is a working workshop and all participants will have an active participation role. We are not collecting abstracts, but rather titles of presentations that participants would like to give. Following registration we will put together an agenda with talks, posters, and discussion sessions. Participants will be notified of their presentation type a month prior to the meeting. You are also welcome to attend without giving a presentation and your input to the working workshop will be through the discussion sessions in addition to Q&A during the oral and poster presentations.


Information on the workshop and how to connect remotely is available [here](https://www.catchscience.org/OpenScienceWorkshop).
