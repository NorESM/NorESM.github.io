This is a 3-day workshop.

## Description

This course covers the modern features of the Fortran programming language. Topics include object-oriented features, language interoperability and several other enhancements included in Fortran 2008 standard. In addition, a way to express distributed memory parallelism via Fortran coarrays will be discussed in detail.

The course provides an overview on all relevant features of Fortran beyond the 95 standard. You will also be able to write parallel programs using the Fortran coarrays concept.

More information and full program at [https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/advancedfortran19](https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/advancedfortran19).

## Prerequisites

Solid knowledge on Fortran 95/2003. The concepts discussed in the PATC introduction course Fortran Programming for Scientific Computing should be well-understood. Knowledge on C will also be needed for understanding the topics on the language interoperability. Familiarity with parallel programming with message-passing interface (MPI) standard will be assumed when discussing the Fortran coarrays. In addition, some familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts will be assumed.
