Learn about ParaView and Ophidia to efficiently analyze and visualize weather and climate data.

# ESiWACE2 HPDA and VIS Course 2021

As the volumes of weather and climate data expand, it is of paramount importance for scientists to exploit techniques and solutions able to efficiently extract knowledge from these data. This training provides insights into data analysis and visualization applied to climate and weather domains, using high-performance data analytics (HPDA) and visualization tools available from the open source market. Examples of real applications of these tools (i.e., Ophidia and ParaView) in the climate and weather domain will be given.
