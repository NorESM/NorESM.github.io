The goal is to take a bottom up approach to explore how the current international standards and tools for managing climate model output can be reused in a Nordic context to help ensure the valuable climate model outputs are FAIR and open. We will use real world output from two global climate models (NorESM and EC-Earth) and plan to work through the process of generating comprehensive metadata from the raw model simulation output. How metadata generation fits into research workflow and data management will also be considered.
