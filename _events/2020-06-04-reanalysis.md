This workshop will focus on the regional reanalysis (RRA) for Europe, which is produced as part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. 

### About the workshop

Reanalysis products are used extensively in a wide range of applications and are among the most used datasets. Users are not only the scientific community but also stakeholders, public organisations and the private sector. Basically all who are in need of long-range climate time series. The most prominent example of reanalyses might be ERA5 – the global reanalysis produced by ECMWF as a contribution to Copernicus. However, the desire for even higher resolution and better quality especially for surface variables is driving the demand for regional reanalysis. The growing number of applications comes from a variety of sectors including wind energy and hydrology as well as for coastal and urban applications.

This workshop will focus on the regional reanalysis (RRA) for Europe, which is produced as part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. 

The UERRA-HARMONIE RRA is available from 1961 to 2019 with a horizontal resolution of 11 km. An additional surface analysis produced with MESCAN-SURFEX is provided at a resolution of 5.5 km. Moreover, the production of the next generation RRA has started. It is called CERRA (Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis) and it includes a surface analysis (CERRA-Land) as well. Both components are produced at 5.5 km horizontal grid spacing.

### WORKSHOP THEMES

This workshop will introduce the service, its systems as well as the RRA products. The added value of the regional reanalysis compared to the global reanalysis will be highlighted. Participating users are invited to present their applications of the RRA in, for example, climate services, energy sectors etc. The layout of the workshop will foster open discussions with the service providers and (potential) users to understand their needs and possible shortcomings in RRA products.
