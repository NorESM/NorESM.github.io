In February 2021, a global 5-day Galaxy Training event showcasing a wide variety of GTN (Galaxy Training Network) tutorials is organized. This will be an online event, spanning all time zones. All training sessions are pre-recorded, so you can work through them at your own pace, and manage your own time. A large community of GTN trainers will be available via online support to answer all your questions. The CTSM-FATES (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator) is offerd on day-5 "Choose your own adventure". 

# Information

The program covers a general introduction to the Galaxy platform, NGS Analysis (DNA-seq and RNA-seq), Proteomics, and also features a Choose your own adventure day on Friday, where we encourage you to explore all the tutorials that the GTN training repository has to offer, and follow those that are of interest to you. The GTN tutorials cover a wide range of scientific topics, from NGS to ecology, climate science, machine learning, visualization, and many more. All the tutorials can be found on the GTN website.
