*Nordic Earth System Modeling Hub is a hub for sharing knowledge and resources to study the Earth's climate in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Norway).*

## Mozsprint May 2019 : Sprint for Internet Health

- During the month of May, 2019 feel free to get involved with NordicESMHub by following the issues on GitHub
- [galaxy-tools mozsprint issues](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/galaxy-tools/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint)
- [NordicESMHub website mozsprint issues](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/nordicesmhub.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint)

#### Help us to fix out github issues during MozSprint 2019!

We created a Github organization called [NordicESMHub](https://github.com/NordicESMhub). It is our collaborative platform and the [NordicESMHub website](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/) is the focal point of our project. Our website is written in markdown to make it easy to contribute.

**We would love to get new contributors**: And you know what?! The good news is that you do not need to live and work in a Nordic country. Help us by reviewing our website, our training material, add links to relevant initiatives, and develop new tools for assessing the climate at high-latitudes. See our issues ([#mozsprint](https://github.com/orgs/NordicESMhub/projects/2)) and contact me if you are interested!

**THANK YOU!!!**
