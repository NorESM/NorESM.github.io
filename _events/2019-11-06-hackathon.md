The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are working with code and/or data in research, in an informal environment where ideas can be exchanged, expertise shared and real work done!

# Welcome to the first CodeRefinery hackathon!

### What you can do at the hackathon:

- Bring your own code or data and get suggestions/help on how to better organize, test, document, and share your code.
- Participate at a ReproHack where we try to reproduce a nominated paper and learn how to make software papers better reproducible. You can nominate your own paper and then you get feedback about how to improve your own work.
- Work on new or existing CodeRefinery lessons.
- Share your expertise with others and learn many new tricks and tools from others.
