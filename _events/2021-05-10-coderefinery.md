In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices for scientific software development. We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps. The tools we teach are practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research software.
