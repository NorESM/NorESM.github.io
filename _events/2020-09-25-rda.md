The concept of Open Science is mostly focused around Open Data and Open Access for published material, with Open Software usually left in the shadow. But in order to ensure transparent and reproducible science, it is essential that also software used in research be adequately documented, curated, preserved and made as FAIR and open as possible! RDA Sweden and EOSC Nordic have undertaken a pilot project to map out current thinking on Open Software and its implications. In this webinar, we will present the outcomes of the project and discuss an upcoming survey on Nordic and Baltic scientists' and stakeholders' attitudes towards FAIR och Open Software.
