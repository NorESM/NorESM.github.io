The aim of the Nordic Earth System Modeling Hub to build a Nordic ESM community within the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Norway) for sharing knowledge, codes (climate models, Galaxy climate data analysis and visualization tools), 
training tutorials so that our contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project can be easily exploited/reused within the Nordic countries and beyond, and by other communities.
